#Sudoku Solver
This is a just 4 fun Project! There are already plenty working Sudoku Solvers out there - nonetheless it's fun to do it on your own :) 

##Capabilities
This c++ based program is capable to:
* solve a set Sudoku. BUT: The Sudoku has to be set manually in the constructor.

##Future Features
1. read in a random sudoku
2. read in a picture of a sudoku
3. Output the Sudoku in augmented reality
4. Generate own Sudoku (a correct Sudoku must have just 1 Solution)
